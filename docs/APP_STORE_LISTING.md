## Description

**Perfect solar panel alignment in seconds.**

TiltSync transforms your iPhone into a precision alignment tool for solar panels. Perfect for DIYers, first-time installers, and anyone who wants professional results without the learning curve. Whether you're a homeowner installing rooftop panels, an RV enthusiast with a portable setup, or setting up your first off-grid system, TiltSync helps you maximize energy production with zero guesswork.

**How it works:**

Place your phone flat on your solar panel. TiltSync uses your device's accelerometer to measure tilt, the magnetometer for compass heading, and GPS for your exact location. The app calculates the optimal angle and direction, then guides you to perfect alignment with haptic feedback that intensifies as you dial it in.

**Precision interface:**

The main display shows a rotating compass card with your heading, a tilt indicator showing panel angle, and real-time digital readouts. It's not just functional, it's beautiful to use.

**Three alignment views:**

◉ **Combined Dashboard** — See tilt and compass alignment together on one screen
◉ **Tilt Mode** — Classic bubble level for dialing in your angle
◉ **Compass Mode** — Dedicated view for azimuth alignment with sun position marker

**Three optimization modes:**

• **Year-Round** — Set it and forget it. Best fixed angle for maximum annual production.

• **Seasonal** — For adjustable mounts. Optimized angles for summer and winter.

• **Daily** — Real-time sun tracking that updates every minute. Perfect for portable panels, camping, and off-grid setups where every watt counts.

**Features:**

◉ Precision interface — Compass, tilt indicator, and real-time readouts
◉ Dark, light, and auto themes — Adapts to your preference or system setting
◉ Color-coded feedback — Green when perfect, yellow when close, red when off
◉ Progressive haptic guidance — Feel your way to alignment without watching the screen
◉ Instant startup — Cached GPS location means no waiting on subsequent launches
◉ Works fully offline — All calculations happen on-device
◉ No account needed — Just open and align

**Built for everyone:**

No solar experience required. The intuitive interface guides you step-by-step, and haptic feedback tells you when you've nailed it — even if you've never aligned a panel before. High-contrast display works in direct sunlight. Dark mode for indoor prep, light mode for outdoor use. Whether you're on a roof, in a field, or at a campsite, TiltSync works where you work.

Stop guessing. Start generating.

## App Review Notes

*Copy/paste the following into the "Notes" field when submitting for App Store review:*

```
Thank you for reviewing TiltSync!

WHAT THE APP DOES:
TiltSync helps users align solar panels for optimal energy production. It uses device sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, GPS) to calculate and display the ideal panel angle and direction based on the user's location.

HOW TO TEST:

1. LOCATION PERMISSION
   - On first launch, the app requests location access
   - This is required to calculate optimal angles based on latitude
   - Grant "While Using" permission to proceed

2. MOTION PERMISSION  
   - The app uses accelerometer and magnetometer sensors
   - These are accessed via expo-sensors and do not require explicit permission prompts on iOS

3. TESTING THE MAIN FEATURES
   - Hold the device flat (screen facing up) to simulate placing it on a panel
   - Tilt the device to see the bubble level / tilt indicator respond
   - Rotate the device to see the compass respond
   - The app will show "ALIGNED" when both tilt and direction match the calculated targets

4. TESTING THE THREE MODES
   - Year-Round: Shows a fixed optimal angle based on latitude
   - Seasonal: Adjusts the target based on current season
   - Daily: Updates every 60 seconds based on real-time sun position

5. THEME TOGGLE
   - Tap the theme icon in the header to cycle between Dark, Light, and Auto modes

NO LOGIN REQUIRED:
The app works immediately without any account creation or sign-in.

NO NETWORK REQUIRED:
After initial download, the app works completely offline. GPS location comes from the device, not network services.
